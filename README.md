Toffee is a C++ utility library designed to make common tasks easier and more efficient.
It is header-only, meaning that you don't need to build any binaries or link
against any libraries - simply include the headers in your project and you're
good to go.


## Features

- Hourglass utilty class
- Instrumentation for profiling
- Easily colorize text
- Random utilities

...And a million things more coming

> Note: In this project I will be adding cool utilities that I make while working on other c++ projects
